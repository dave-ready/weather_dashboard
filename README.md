# Weather Dashboard Homework

  For this homework assignment, I created a weather dashboard app with search functionality to find any given city's current weather conditions as well as it's projected five-day forecast. The app uses AJAX to retrieve city data from OpenWeather API and includes dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  It also displays a search history which the user can click to access past city searches via local storage. 
  The current weather conditions include the city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.), temperature, humidity and wind speed.  It will also include the UV Index along with a color representation of the UV conditions(ie. green = favorable, orange = moderate and red = severe). The five-day forecast includes the date, an icon representing the conditions, as well as the temperature and humidity. 
  Technologies used were HTML:5, Javascript, Bootstrap 4, Font Awesome, jQuery, moment.js, and Open Weather API.
